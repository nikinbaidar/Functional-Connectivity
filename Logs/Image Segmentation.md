# Image Segmentation

Image segmentation is a commonly used technique in digital image
processing and analysis to partition an image into multiple parts or
regions, often based on the characteristics of the pixels in the
image. Image segmentation could involve separating foreground from
background, or clustering regions of pixels based on similarities in
color or shape. For example, a common application of image
segmentation in medical imaging is to detect and label pixels in an
image or voxels of a 3D volume that represent a tumor in a patient's
brain.


## How Image Segmentation Works

Image segmentation involves converting an image into a collection of
regions of pixels that are represented by a mask or labeled image. By
dividing an image into segments, you can process only the important
segments of the image instead of processing the entire image.

A common technique is to look for abrupt discontinuities in pixel
values, which typically indicate edges that define a region.

* Image Segmentation Techniques

  Different approaches to image segmentation, including automatic
  thresholding, edge-based methods, and morphology-based methods.

* 3D Segmentation

  Use programmatic functions and interactive apps to perform 3D
  segmentation. You can use thresholding, active contours, semantic
  segmentation and other techniques to perform segmentation of 3D
  Data.
